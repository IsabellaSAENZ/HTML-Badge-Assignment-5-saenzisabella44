 <h2>Southern Classic Chicken has been a family institution in North Louisiana for the past 35 years!  Dedicated to serving the absolute best fried chicken and sides at a price point that provides an incredible value has been the goal since day one and will continue on as the company moves forward.  No corners are cut in sourcing the freshest products possible. 

In 2019, Southern Classic Chicken decided to expand and offer more people the opportunity to experience their delicious fresh fried chicken.  Franchising efforts have started, and future expansion is under way.  From Texas to Mississippi and the Southern parts of Louisiana, Southern Classic Chicken will be looking for great restaurant partners to help grow. 

Thank you to all those who have helped us over the last 35 years, and we look forward to a successful future!
